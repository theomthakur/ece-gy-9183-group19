# ece-gy-9183-group19

## Title of project

<!-- 
Discuss: Value proposition: Your will propose a machine learning system that can be 
used in an existing business or service. (You should not propose a system in which 
a new business or service would be developed around the machine learning system.) 
Describe the value proposition for the machine learning system. What’s the (non-ML) 
status quo used in the business or service? What business metric are you going to be 
judged on? (Note that the “service” does not have to be for general users; you can 
propose a system for a science problem, for example.)

### Contributors

<!-- Table of contributors and their roles. 
First row: define responsibilities that are shared by the team. 
Then, each row after that is: name of contributor, their role, and in the third column, 
you will link to their contributions. If your project involves multiple repos, you will 
link to their contributions in all repos here. -->

### System diagram

<!-- Overall digram of system. Doesn't need polish, does need to show all the pieces. 
Must include: all the hardware, all the containers/software platforms, all the models, 
all the data. -->


<!-- In a table, a row for each dataset, foundation model. 
Name of data/model, conditions under which it was created (ideally with links/references), 
conditions under which it may be used. -->

### Summary of outside materials

|                                      | How it was created | Conditions of use |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| VinBigData Chest X-Ray dataset | [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.15029) | See Usage Notes section in the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.15029) |
| YOLOv11-L | [Documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/) | [AGPL 3.0 Software License](https://www.ultralytics.com/legal/agpl-3-0-software-license) |


### Summary of infrastructure requirements

<!-- Itemize all your anticipated requirements: What (`m1.medium` VM, `gpu_mi100`), 
how much/when, justification. Include compute, floating IPs, persistent storage. 
The table below shows an example, it is not a recommendation. -->

| Requirement     | How many/when                                     | Justification |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `m1.medium` VMs | 3 for entire project duration                     | ...           |
| `gpu_mi100`     | 4 hour block twice a week                         |               |
| Floating IPs    | 1 for entire project duration, 1 for sporadic use |               |
| etc             |                                                   |               |

### Detailed design plan

<!-- In each section, you should describe (1) your strategy, (2) the relevant parts of the 
diagram, (3) justification for your strategy, (4) relate back to lecture material, 
(5) include specific numbers. -->

#### Model training and training platforms

<!-- Make sure to clarify how you will satisfy the Unit 4 and Unit 5 requirements, 
and which optional "difficulty" points you are attempting. -->

#### Model serving and monitoring platforms

<!-- Make sure to clarify how you will satisfy the Unit 6 and Unit 7 requirements, 
and which optional "difficulty" points you are attempting. -->

#### Data pipeline

<!-- Make sure to clarify how you will satisfy the Unit 8 requirements,  and which 
optional "difficulty" points you are attempting. -->

#### Continuous X

<!-- Make sure to clarify how you will satisfy the Unit 3 requirements,  and which 
optional "difficulty" points you are attempting. -->
